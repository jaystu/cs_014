Program Description: Hashes a dictionary and compares user inputted words for fast and easy spell checking. Also prints statistics for type of hash table used (separate chaining or quadratic probing).

sample input -> -1 -chain sample.txt
             -> -2 -probe sample.txt
             
IMPORTANT!!!
hashing the big dictionary and finding the stats for Quadratic probing could take as 
long as like 20 seconds so please be patient because it works :)

to make: type in "make all"
